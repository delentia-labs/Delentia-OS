"""
Delentia MCP Server — exposes the 41-algorithm kernel as real MCP tools.

Round 21 Phase 2: the first concrete piece of a real agentic loop. This
lets ANY MCP client (Claude Code, a future Hermes-style runtime, this
kernel's own future multi-agent dispatch) call into the kernel's real
capabilities using the same protocol delentia-mcp-ecosystem already
speaks — reusing an existing standard instead of inventing a new
tool-call wire format.

Uses `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer` (the real, current mcp>=2.0 API —
`FastMCP` was renamed to `MCPServer` in mcp 2.x; confirmed by direct
inspection of the installed package, not assumed from older docs).
